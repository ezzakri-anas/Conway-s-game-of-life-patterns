Puffer train

This was created simply by perturbing
the sides of a B-heptomino with two
LWSS's. A B-heptomino is a naturally
occurring object, a precursor to the
Herschel pattern, which lurches forward
at the speed c/2 before its own debris
usually destroys it. Not in this case!
The LWSS keep it alive. See Rakes,
LinePuffer.
